# Deep-dream

https://github.com/Rubiel1/Deep-dream/blob/master/DeepDream.ipynb

My Jupyter Notebook presentation for the FSU machine learning seminar on Deep Dreams.

I took ideas from different sources.

The original source requires Caffe https://github.com/google/deepdream/blob/master/dream.ipynb

This tensorflow tutorial allows you to choose your convenet and select the layers that you want to focus on. https://github.com/llSourcell/deep_dream_challenge/blob/master/deep_dream.py

Here you can also add an image and then the algorithm will detect which layers are leaning that pattern, then you can do dreams with that pattern. Since this code requires coffe, I modified it to work with the previous link. https://github.com/burningion/deepdreamtutorial/blob/master/divingdeeper.ipynb

Here is a complete implementation using keras: https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks/blob/master/8.2-deep-dream.ipynb
